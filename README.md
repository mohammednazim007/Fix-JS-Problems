Here are some key tips:
Keep it short and clear: Aim for 50 characters or less.
Use imperative mood: "Fix bug" instead of "Fixes bug".

Consistent formatting: Stick to a standard format.

1. Fixing a Bug:
   fix(auth): fix login issue #123
   Fix the login issue by updating the authentication logic.

4. Refactoring Code:

   Refactor the authentication module to improve code readability and maintainability.

5. Performance Optimization:
   perf(api): optimize API response time

6. Testing:
   test(auth): add unit tests for authentication module
