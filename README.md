🚀 Git Tips for Developers!
Just learned how to write professional commit messages for GitHub! 📝
Commit messages are like the breadcrumbs of your coding journey. They help you and your team navigate through changes, understand the context, and maintain a clean and readable version control history.

Here are some key tips:
Keep it short and clear: Aim for 50 characters or less.
Use imperative mood: "Fix bug" instead of "Fixes bug".
Be descriptive: Avoid vague terms like "Update".
Include relevant info: Mention issue numbers and branch names.
Consistent formatting: Stick to a standard format.

Examples:
1. Fixing a Bug:
fix(auth): fix login issue #123
Fix the login issue by updating the authentication logic.

2. Adding a Feature:
feat(ui): add new user profile page
Add a new user profile page with user details and settings.

3. Documentation Update:
docs(readme): update README with new installation instructions
Update the README file to include new installation instructions.

4. Refactoring Code:
refactor(auth): refactor authentication module
Refactor the authentication module to improve code readability and maintainability.

5. Performance Optimization:
perf(api): optimize API response time
Optimize the API response time by implementing caching and reducing database queries.
