üöÄ Git Tips for Developers!
Just learned how to write professional commit messages for GitHub! üìù
Commit messages are like the breadcrumbs of your coding journey. They help you and your team navigate through changes, understand the context, and maintain a clean and readable version control history.

Here are some key tips:
Keep it short and clear: Aim for 50 characters or less.
Use imperative mood: "Fix bug" instead of "Fixes bug".
Be descriptive: Avoid vague terms like "Update".
Include relevant info: Mention issue numbers and branch names.
Consistent formatting: Stick to a standard format.

Examples:

1. Fixing a Bug:
   fix(auth): fix login issue #123
   Fix the login issue by updating the authentication logic.

2. Adding a Feature:
   feat(ui): add new user profile page
   Add a new user profile page with user details and settings.

3. Documentation Update:
   docs(readme): update README with new installation instructions
   Update the README file to include new installation instructions.

4. Refactoring Code:
   refactor(auth): refactor authentication module
   Refactor the authentication module to improve code readability and maintainability.

5. Performance Optimization:
   perf(api): optimize API response time
   Optimize the API response time by implementing caching and reducing database queries.

6. Testing:
   test(auth): add unit tests for authentication module
   Add unit tests for the authentication module to ensure its functionality.

7. Chores:
   chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions
   Update all project dependencies to their latest versions to ensure compatibility and security.

docker run -p (custom port 8080):(EXPOSE 8000) image-name

# Run the docker image in a container with (--rm) to automatically remove the container when it exits.
docker run -p 8005:8000 --rm app-node:v1

# To stop a running docker container
docker container stop 6412c863db20

# To start a stopped docker container

# To remove a docker image
docker rmi image-name

# To remove a specific docker image
docker rmi node-app:v1

# To remove a docker container
docker rm container-id 

# To list all the docker images
docker image ls

# To display the running docker containers
docker container ls

# To display the running docker containers with hidden containers
docker container ls -a

# This command removes all stopped containers ‚Äî it won‚Äôt touch running ones.
docker container prune -f

# This command removes all unused images ‚Äî it won‚Äôt touch running ones.
docker image prune -a
