üöÄ Git Tips for Developers!

Commit messages are like the breadcrumbs of your coding journey. They help you and your team navigate through changes, understand the context, and maintain a clean and readable version control history.

Here are some key tips:
Keep it short and clear: Aim for 50 characters or less.
Use imperative mood: "Fix bug" instead of "Fixes bug".

Include relevant info: Mention issue numbers and branch names.
Consistent formatting: Stick to a standard format.

   fix(auth): fix login issue #123
